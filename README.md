# UX

This Website is for anyone looking to gather information about places 

- as a visitor, I would like a world map 
- as a visitor, I would like to choose which location I want to see
- as a visitor, I would like to select places relevant to my next holiday (accommodation, travel, touristic attractions, food, drink,)
- as a visitor, i would like information about those places (address, website, rating, open times, telephone number )
- as a visitor, I would like to have a street view option
- as a visitor, I would like to be able to control the map (zoom, drag, select)


# Features

	- This is a simple one-page application with the following features

	- World map 
	- location(city,town,village) search functionality with autocomplete 
	- ability to browse trough options and select the type of place user are looking for 
	- custom markers for each place type
	- on user selection(click marker or item from list) display relevant information about a specific place 
	- map controlls (zoom,drag,select)
	- 360* street view (where such option is available(some remote locations do not have this feature yet implemented))
	- ability to open a certain place in google maps (click on place name in the infowindow)
	- different map themes (Map , Satellite)
	- full screen map option 


# Features Left To Implement
	- None

# TESTING

- Extensive testing has been carried out at the time of implementation for each new piece of functionality
- testing has been carried out on all major browsers and some mobile devices
- usability test has been carried out by friends and family 
- the website renders accordingly on all screen sizes down to 360px

# Individual Feature Testing 
	- the place search functionality works as intended returning accurate place name predictions 
	- place type functionality works as intended returning accurate results
	- custom markers provide clear visual differentiation between place types
	- info window provides the user with accurate relevant information about a specific place (when such information is available)
	- map controls work as intended both on desktop and mobile (full-screen map is required on mobile devices to receive a more accurate user experience)
	- 360* View works as intended (mobile devices will provide a better experience as the map will use the device's auto-rotate feature)
	- different map themes work as intended providing end-user different view options

# UI

 The design of this website has been made to provide users with a fun interactive and non-intrusive way to explore places around the world 
 Chosen Color-theme provides the user the ability to focus on the 3 main pieces of functionality (Map, Search Options and result list)
